# Audiobook_returning_clients
Here I used TensorFlow to create model that will help us predict if an already exist customer will return and purchase another audiobook. 
The data consists of 12 features and 14,000+ observations. I cleaned and balanced the dataset so that our results are not overfitted to one specific 
target output. I created a neural network with a depth of 50 layers, Relu and Softmax activation functions and it returned an accuracy of 82.59%
