    "You are given data from an Audiobook app. Logically, it relates only to the audio versions of books. Each customer in the databse has made a purchase at least once, thats why he/she is in the database. We want to create a machine learning algorithm bases od our available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that if a customer has a low probability of coming back, there is no reason to spend any money on advertizing to him/her. If we can focus our efforts ONLY on customers that are likely to convert again, we can make great savings. Moreover, this model can identify the most important metrics for a customer to come back again. Identifying new customers creates calue and growth opportunities. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have a .csv summarizing the data. Ther are several variables: Customer ID, Book length in mins_avg(average of all purchases), Book length in minutes_sum(sum of all purchases), Price Paid_avg(average of all purchases), Price paid_sum(sum of all purchases), Review*(a boolean variable), Review(out of 10), Total minutes listened, Completion(from 0 to 1), SUpport requests(numer), and Last visited minus purchase date(in days).\n",
    "\n",
    "So these are the inputs (excluding Customer ID, as it is completely arbitrary. Its more like a name, than a number)\n",
    "\n",
    "The targets are Boolean variable(so 0 or 1). We are taking a period of 2 years in our inputs, and the next 6 months as a targets. So, in fact, we are predicting if: based on the last 2 years of activity and engagement, a customer will convert in the next 6 months. 6 months sounds like a reasonable time. If they dont convert after 6 months, chances are theyve gone to a competitor or didnt like the Audtiobook way of difesting information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is simple: create a machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classification problem with two classes: wont buy and will buy represented by 0s and 1s.\n"
